# **MiniOS:**

MiniOS is a simple desktop-style interface built entirely with pure HTML and CSS, without JavaScript, frameworks, or external libraries.

The main page works like a small operating system, where each application opens inside a modal window using an iframe.

All applications are visual-only prototypes, meant to showcase layout, UI structure, and design concepts.


## **How MiniOS Works**

index.html acts as the main desktop.
Each desktop icon opens a modal window using anchor targets (#ventana, #ventana1, etc.).
Inside each modal, an iframe loads one of the apps located in the apps/ folder.
There is no JavaScript, so all functionality is purely visual.


**Applications Included**

1. Biblioteca

A small digital library interface with a set of book cards.
Built entirely with HTML and CSS.

2. Homeworks
A to-do list style layout with checkboxes and UI elements for adding or removing tasks.
Only visual—no logical functionality yet.

3. Weather
A simple weather display showing basic weather information for Medellín, Bogotá, and Cali.

4. Spoty
A visual recreation of a Spotify-style music interface.
Purely UI, no audio playback.

5. Bloc
A basic notes-style UI that simulates a classic notepad.

## **Purpose of the Project**

MiniOS was created as a practice project to explore:

Multi-window UI layouts

Iframe-based app embedding

CSS-only modals and transitions

UI design without JavaScript or frameworks

Structuring a multi-page HTML/CSS project



## **How to Run the Project**

Simply open index.html in any modern browser.

No installation, dependencies, build steps, or servers are required.





## **Notes**

This project is purely visual and contains no functional logic.

It is ideal as a UI/UX or HTML/CSS practice environment.

JavaScript functionality can be added in the future to turn each app into an interactive tool.
